In the most simple terms, the object of the game is to collect the other players' flags before they capture yours. Players must roll a double on two dice to place a ladder or blocker, which they may use to either move about the board more efficiently, or help to protect their flag. As an extra-special addition, any player whose combination adds up to 9 may choose a player to send back to the start. The game is intended for \"those who can count and up\", so about 8+, with 2-4 players. I designed the game board myself, using a lazy susan, acrylic, cardstock, and magnetic tape.

I enjoyed my time developing pictures in the dark room, sequencing in the studio, and most importantly, I loved shooting at new locations. I quickly figured out that my best work as a photographer came from being somewhere I haven't been before. When taking pictures at unfamiliar place, I pay extra attention to my surroundings. For example, I observe the direction of the light, lines of symmetry, color, and the role of people. My desire to know the place helps me see it from a different perspective. As a result, I wanted to take advantage of my senior project as an opportunity to explore different locations and create a photography portfolio. The locations I explored extend all the way from Guatemala to the neighborhood around my block. This project allowed me to express my artistic side one last time, and I created many memories with those who came along with me to my adventures.","projectLink":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SfuniLt8DKLxpKy73Nu26mVwuiAgtJO0?usp=sharing","mentor":"Mr. Cook","category":"Developing_Voice","imageOne":"Fabio_Yales.jpg","imageTwo":""},{"studentName":"Katie Yang","gradYear":"2021","projectName":"musings in action; so i built a computer","desc":"For a while in my life, it felt like goals such as building a computer were so far out of my reach, even though I had peers who had already embarked on the task.

As I delved deeper into research during the height of a global pandemic I realized just how widespread its impact was.

Soul searching, life learning; untangling myself through cables and wires has inspired and educated me more than I ever fathomed.","projectLink":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dubZyJ38aHD5yTotELAYmQ0XAatonbQ3?usp=sharing","mentor":"Mrs. Schulte","category":"Personal_Writing","imageOne":"","imageTwo":""},{"studentName":"Jacob Yim","gradYear":"2021","projectName":"Bucket List of writing","desc":"I've always wanted to try sending something into a writing magazine.
